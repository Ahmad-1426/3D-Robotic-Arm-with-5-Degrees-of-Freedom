# 3D-Robotic-Arm-with-5-Degrees-of-Freedom




## Overview
This project is a 3D model of a robotic arm created using **Tinkercad**. The arm features four degrees of freedom and is designed to demonstrate the basic motion capabilities of an industrial robotic arm.

## Tools Used
- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) – for 3D modeling
- GitHub – for version control and sharing
- (Optional) Arduino – for future integration and motion simulation

## Features
- Fixed circular base
- Multiple movable joints (4-DOF)
- Functional gripper at the end-effector
- Simple and educational design, ideal for beginners

## Possible Applications
- Educational robotics
- Mechatronics projects
- 3D printing practice
- Simulation and control using Arduino or similar microcontrollers
